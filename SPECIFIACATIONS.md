# ðŸ”ŒThe Network Project (TNP)ðŸ”Œ
This is an app that allows to manage or simulate your network with a simple interface and withouth any knowledge.
It will implement tutorials, network simulations, hardware configurators, software configurators, operating systems configurator etc...

# What wil you be able to do ?
In TNP, you will be able to configure a simple or complex network with ease : you can create/manage a school network, a society network, your home network, your LAN party or whatever you want.
You will have a hardware configurator which will allow you to get a config for a server or a pc, or even have the best configuration for your network within your budget.
Simulate a network to preview how will it work, what you will need and what will it be able to do.

# What can you create in your network ?
TNP will allow you to manage servers, routers, modems, eventually computers and maybe more (even if you cannot configure it within TNP you will still be able to configure other thnigs such as its place in the network)
TNP will allow with only a few clicks to create a web server, a game server, a database, with explainations and total management.

ðŸ› This project is under construction, once the beta is out, you will be able to contribute to this project. :), stay tuned for more!ðŸ›
